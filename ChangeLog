 * Initialized repository, created server.py and README.
 
Jason Bull:

1/15/2014:  Updated server.py to return an HTTP 1.0 response containing ‘200 OK’ response line,
a ‘Content-type’ of text/html, and a message body saying ‘<h1>Hello, world</h1> this is jbull477’s Web server.

1/19/2014:  Updated sever.py so that carriage returns and newlines are used when returning the HTTP response.

1/23/2014:  Finished hw2.  POST requests are handled and all tests are working.
