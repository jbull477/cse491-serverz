 * Working Homework 8. (Homework 6 and 7 work too, just forgot to update the ChangeLog).
   The project that I have added was the thumbnail images.
   Instructions on how to run my program now:
     In command line type "python2.7 server.py -A myapp" and it will give you a link to an address.
     Visit that address and click on the "Thumbnail" link, that will take you to the page i added.
